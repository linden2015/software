\begin_layout Title
Essentials of LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Stephen Wolff and Liviu Andronic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is intended to provide an overview of the essential features
 and functions of LyX, to give you a basic working knowledge of the software,
 and to enable you to begin typesetting beautiful documents with the powerful
 LaTeX system.
 It also discusses some of the more advanced topics and potential issues
 that you will invariably encounter when creating LyX documents.

\begin_layout Section
What Is LyX?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
``LyX combines the power and flexibility of TeX/LaTeX with the ease of use
 of a graphical interface.
 This results in world-class support for creation of mathematical content
 (via a fully integrated equation editor) and structured documents like
 academic articles, theses, and books.''
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In brief, LyX is an easy-to-use typesetting environment that uses the power
 of LaTeX to produce beautiful documents.
 Like Microsoft Word, LyX provides an intuitive graphical-user interface
 that automatically takes care of the LaTeX ``programming''.
 However, LyX then uses the underlying LaTeX software to produce professional-qu
ality output that Microsoft Word can only dream of.
 LyX is also similar in scope to Scientific WorkPlace, but is accessible
 at a price that no commercial rival can beat: it's 
\emph on
free
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MS Word comes with the concept of WYSIWYG, literally meaning that what you
 see on the screen is what you get printed on the paper.
 LyX (and LaTeX) cannot do this by design, and can only give you a hint
 of how the printed output 
\emph on
would 
\emph default
look like.
 Hence the ``almost WYSIWYG
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 concept.
 The actual output depends on the chosen document class and various options,
 and you need to generate the PDF to get a clear idea of the final output.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How to Obtain LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
 You can download the version corresponding to your operating system from
 the LyX Download page:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://www.lyx.org/Download"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
If you are using a Mac, you will also have to install a LaTeX distribution
 (the LyX Download page provides a link to 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "MacTeX"
target "http://www.tug.org/mactex/"

\end_inset

).
 The LyX versions for Windows and Linux already come bundled with a LaTeX
 distribution, so in most cases you do not need to worry for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
LyX 2.0
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latest stable version is being released this week and is recommended
 for most users.
 It provides several new features (real-time spell checking, support for
 R, XeTeX, etc.) that many of you may find useful.
 Binaries for Windows and Mac OS X will shortly be available on this page:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/2.0.0/"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Windows users, when installing LyX for the first time, prefer the ``Bundle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 installer, since it will also install a LaTeX distribution and some additional
 software that is used by LyX.
 Mac users, don't forget to also install a LaTeX distribution.
 For Linux users, the source code is already available here:

\begin_layout Subsection
How to Create and Compile a Document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To create a new LyX document, launch the LyX program, and from the menu
 at the top of the screen click 
\family typewriter
\color blue
File
\family default
\color inherit
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
\color blue
New
\family default
\color inherit
 (if you have a template you wish to use, select 
\family typewriter
\color blue
File
\family default
\color inherit
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
\color blue
New from Template...
\family default
\color inherit
).
 A LyX document window will appear; let the writing begin! Note, however,
 that what you see in the LyX document window is not quite what the final
 output will look like (cf ``almost WYSIWYG
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see your document in all of its finalized LaTeX glory, you will have
 to compile your document.
 This, in LyX, consists of clicking a single icon: the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
View PDF (pdflatex)
\family default
\color inherit
 icon at the top left of the LyX document window
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You can switch the viewing format to either 
\family typewriter
\color blue
DVI
\family default
\color inherit
 or 
\family typewriter
\color blue
PostScript
\family default
\color inherit
, but do so only if you are familiar with differences between these formats.
 For most uses 
\family typewriter
\color blue
PDF
\family default
\color inherit
 is the optimal choice.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 When you want to view what the final output will look like, save your document
 (
\family typewriter
\color blue
File
\family default
\color inherit
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Save
\family default
\color inherit
, or the appropriate hot keys), click on the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
View
\family default
\color inherit
 icon, and LyX will compile your document and display the final PDF output
 in a separate window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
\color blue
View
\family default
\color inherit
 icon is practical for 
\emph on
previewing
\emph default
 your final output, but it is generally a good habit to use

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Value of Backups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a general rule, LyX is rock-solid and works like a Swiss watch.
 However, the very nature of LaTeX files means that sometimes something
 can get messed up and render your document un-compilable (this can happen
 with MS Word too, when your document gets corrupted).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid any such surprises, especially just before the deadline, it is
 strongly recommended to use a general purpose file backup programme such
 as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Dropbox"
target "https://www.dropbox.com/"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "SpiderOak"
target "https://spideroak.com/"

\end_inset

.
 Both are free to use, cross-platform and 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 easy to set up.
 They are also extremely easy to use in your day-to-day computer work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effort is minimal, and the benefits could be highly rewarding (as in:
 `you managed to submit the thesis in time').
 Thus, when something strange happens and you can no longer compile your
 document and cannot find the root cause, you can simply (and easily) revert
 to an older version of your document using one of these tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Document Settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX automatically takes care of most of the formatting aspects of a document
 (layout, spacing, etc.), allowing the user to focus on the content of the
 document.
 However, there may be times you want to change the general appearance of
 your document, and for these times it is useful to be acquainted with the
 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Document
\family default
\color inherit
 toolbar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When starting a new document, first you will want to decide on the type
 of the document and the appropriate LaTeX class, and on several general
 aspects of the document layout.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Document Classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX comes with numerous pre-defined document classes, or ``types'' of documents.
 The most commonly used document classes include
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
article
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
book
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
letter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
presentation (slides)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Document classes differ in their available headings (for example, you can
 use ``chapter'' in the book class, but not in the article class) and their
 layout.
 For most shorter papers, the ``article'' class will serve us perfectly.
 To see the full list of document classes, or to change the type of your
 document, click on the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Document
\family default
\color inherit
 tab in the toolbar (at the top of the window or screen) and click on 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Settings...

\family default
\color inherit
 in the dropdown menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Text Layout, Page Layout, and Page Margins
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Document Settings
\family default
\color inherit
 window, you can alter several settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Text Layout
\family default
\color inherit
 tab allows you to change the separation between paragraphs and the spacing
 between lines (single spaced, double spaced, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Page Layout
\family default
\color inherit
 tab allows you to change the paper format (A4, US letter, etc.), orientation
 (portrait versus landscape), and headers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Page Margins
\family default
\color inherit
 tab allows you to change certain spacing parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fonts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Document Settings
\family default
\color inherit
 window also contains a 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Fonts
\family default
\color inherit
 tab that allows you to change the default fonts and font size used in your
 document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain professional looking and stylish results, one should use as few
 fonts as possible in any given document.
 For consistency, LyX (and LaTeX) allow the use of only three types of fonts:
 Serif (also called Roman, used for most of the text in a document), 
\family sans
Sans Serif (used sometimes for headings)
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Typewriter (used mostly for code)
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please note that the default font in LyX is hardly suitable for printed
 output (long story!), and you will always want to use some other font.
 
\noun on
``
\noun default
Latin Modern
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seems a reasonable choice to begin with, but you are free to experiment
 with the various fonts available (for example, ``Palatino
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as used in this document).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also use ``Old Style Figures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (0123456789), as you can notice in this document, by clicking the relevant
 checkbox.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the first things that you want to set in a new document is the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Language
\family default
\color inherit
 in 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Document Settings
\family default
\color inherit
.
 However, this defaults to English so it should suit most of us for the
 mémoire.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Section, Subsections, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX greatly simplifies the writing of ``structured'' documents, that is,
 documents with chapters, sections, subsections, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To add a new section, subsection, etc.
 to your document, simply go to the menu bar at the top right of your document
 window, which probably contains the word ``Standard'' (referring to the
 current environment).
 Click on this menu bar, and then select the section level you want (section,
 subsection, etc.) from the ``Section'' part of the dropdown menu.
 Notice that LyX automatically takes care of the numbering for you! Furthermore,
 if you decide you want to move a certain section, subsection, etc.
 to a different part of your document, just cut and paste; again LyX will
 automatically adjust of the numbering! (N.B.
 This automatic renumbering applies equally well to other numbered objects:
 list items, equations, etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't want a section numbered, choose the appropriate section level
 under the ``Unnumbered'' part of the dropdown menu (section*, subsection*,
 etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you decide you want to change a section level (e.g.
 upgrade a subsection into a full-blown section), simply select the relevant
 section text in your document (or just click somewhere in the relevant
 section text) and select the new desired section level from the dropdown
 menu at the top of the LyX document window.
 You can also use the ``Tab'' key to perform such changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To easily make two Sections switch places, you can use 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Document
\family default
\color inherit
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
\color blue

Right-click to access context-menu
\family default
\color inherit
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Move section up / down
\family default

.
 It is generally a good idea to use Outline to browse your LyX document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Table of Contents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To add a table of contents to your document, go to the toolbar at the top
 of the screen and click on

The words ``Table of Contents'' will appear where you left your cursor.
 Note that the full table of contents only appers in the compiled version
 your document.

---can be found under the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Text style
\family default
\color inherit
 tab (the icon with the image ``a
\shape italic
b
\shape default
'') at the top of the LyX document window.
 (If you have sized your document window very small, you may have to click
 on the two ``right arrows'' at the far right of the window to reveal more
 options and see this icon.) The bold option can be found under the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Series
\family default
\color inherit
 menu, italics and small caps under 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Shape
\family default
\color inherit
, and standard font colors under (surprise) 
\family typewriter
\color blue

.
 To apply these typesetting options to a particular part of your document,
 simply highlight the text you want to adjust, then select the desired action
 from the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Text style
\family default
\color inherit
 menu, and click the ``Apply'' button.
 You can also bring up the Text style menu by highlighting the relevant
 text and right-clicking (or control-clicking); a dropdown menu will appear,
 from which you can select 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another neat feature of LyX is the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Apply last

 icon (containing the word ``Font'' above a downward-pointing arrow, right
 next to the 
\family typewriter
\color blue

 and 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Toggle noun
\family default
\color inherit
 buttons) at the top of the LyX document window.
 If you highlight some text and click this icon, the text will be formatted
 with the style that you used last.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Justification of Text
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the justification (center, right-justify, etc.) or spacing between
 lines (single, double, etc.), select the relevant text in your document,
 then click on the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Paragraph settings
\family default
\color inherit
 icon at the top of the LyX document window.
 This is also the icon to click when you wish to specify whether a paragraph
 should start with or without an indent (important when you have text following
 a math environment; see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Math-Basics"

\end_inset

 below); this is done by checking or unchecking the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Indent Paragraph
\family default

 box in the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Paragraph settings
\family default

\begin_layout Standard
To manually add horizontal or vertical space at a particular point in your
 document, click on 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert

 from the toolbar at the top of the screen, then 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX (and LaTeX) gently prohibit the use of multiple spaces or new lines,
 which is almost always a bad idea.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Footnotes, Marginal Notes, and Comments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To add a footnote, put your cursor where you want the superscript number
 linking to the footnote to appear, then either click the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert footnote
\family default
\color inherit
 icon at the top of the LyX document window, or click 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert
\family default
\color inherit
 and select 
\family typewriter

Footnote
\family default
\color inherit
 from the dropdown menu.
 You can add a marginal note the same way, via either the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert margin note 
\family default
\color inherit
icon or the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert
\family default
\color inherit
 tab.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, if you want to make a note to yourself that doesn't appear in the
 actual document (what is commonly called a ``comment'' in computer programming
 lingo), put your cursor where you want the note to appear and click the
 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert note
\family default
\color inherit
 icon at the top of the LyX document window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is an example of a sentence that uses a footnote,
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
N.B.
 It is customary to start the footnote 
\shape italic
after
\shape default
 any punctuation following the word after which you wish the footnote to
 begin.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 margin note,
\begin_inset Marginal
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Marginal notes appear in the outer margin of the final document; by default,
 the first line of the margin note is level with the line in which the text-body
 word preceding the margin note appears.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and comment (what LyX calls Note).
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Personally, I prefer the term ``Comment'' to ``Note''.
 Which is why you see the annoying ``comment/note'' complex in the following
 sentence.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Within the LyX document window, you can expand or collapse the text of
 a footnote, margin note, and comment/note by clicking the word ``foot#'',
 ``margin'', or ``Note'' appearing at the beginning of the note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quotation Marks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that LyX distinguishes between the left-quotation mark key ` and the
 right-quotation mark key ' found on the keyboard.
 If you use the double-quotation mark key 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 to type the quotation marks on both sides of a word or phrase, LyX will
 automatically correct the orientation of the first set of quotation marks.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This phrase is surrounded by double-quotation marks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, LyX does not autocorrect single-quotation marks.
 For example, 'This phrase is surrounded by two right single-quotation marks'.
 Note that the left-quotation mark, appearing at the start of this phrase,
 is oriented incorrectly.
 Use instead the left single-quotation mark at the beginning; `The preceding
 is a left single-quotation mark; what follows is a right single-quotation
 mark'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hyphenation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LaTeX is usually good at hyphenating your text and does so automatically.
 But sometimes it can fail spectacularly and generate curious results.
 
\end_layout

spacings.
 The 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Math spacings

 For example, you may want to add space on either side of the implications

\]

\end_inset

To add this horizontal space, simply put your text cursor where you want
 the extra space to appear and click the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Math spacings
\family default

 Adding a quadratin space, for example, to either side of the implication

Fonts.
 As its name suggests, the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Fonts
\family default

 symbols appearing in a math environment.
 A few commonly used fonts, illustrated in the following expression, are
 Boldsymbol (used for 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{X}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}$
\end_inset

 below), Blackboard (used for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}$
\end_inset

), Calligraphic (used for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}$
\end_inset

), and Normal text mode (used to so that the variance operator displays
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Var}$
\end_inset

, rather than the default appearance 
\begin_inset Formula $Var$
\end_inset

): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{X}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbb{E}\left[\boldsymbol{\theta}\right],\textrm{Var}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Functions.
 Clicking the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Functions
\family default

\begin_inset Formula $\exp$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\max$
\end_inset

, etc.
 N.B.
 To add a subscript and/or superscript to compatible functions, first use
 the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Functions
\family default
\color inherit
 icon to write the function, then click the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Subscript
\family default
\color inherit
 icon and type the subscript.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\sin^{2}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Another potentially useful fact to note is that certain mathematical expression
s display slightly differently when used in inline versus separate-line
 math environments.
 Writing the same limit expression in the Display Formula environment, for
 example, results in
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\sin^{2}(x).
\]

\end_inset

Note that the subscript appears directly underneath the limit function,
 rather than to the right as it does in the inline math environment.

\begin_layout Description
Parentheses.
 The various parentheses icons allows you to add paired parentheses (round
 parentheses, square brackets, curly braces) to math environmonts.
 Note that the parentheses provided by these icons automatically adjust
 to the size of the expression contained within the parentheses; in contrast,
 parentheses you type using the keyboard will not self-adjust! While a fast
 reader may not notice the difference between the keyboard parentheses in
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\frac{1}{2})$
\end_inset

 and the parentheses from the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert ()
\family default
\color inherit
 icon in 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 for inline math environments, she will certainly notice a difference in
 separate-line math environments, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(\frac{1}{2})\qquad\textrm{versus}\qquad f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right),
\]

\end_inset

especially if you are displaying a large mathematical object like a matrix,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
c & d
\end{array})\qquad\textrm{versus}\qquad\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
c & d
\end{array}\right).
\]

\end_inset

The keyboard parentheses simply look risible.
 Use the power of LaTeX that LyX makes available with one click of the various
 parentheses icons! If you need to mix-and-match parentheses-types, as illustrat

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\begin_layout Standard
A powerful feature of LaTeX is its ability and flexibility in allowing internal
 (and external!) referencing.
 You can reference almost anything that is numbered: sections, subsections,
 etc., as well as equations and figures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Referencing works in two steps: labeling and referencing.
 We provide two illustrations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Referencing Sections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's suppose we want to add a reference here directing the reader to the
 section ``Math Basics''.
 To do so, first put your text cursor at the end of the section title, go
 to the top of the LyX document window, and click the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert label
\family default
\color inherit
 icon (the icon with the picture of a label).
 A 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Label
\family default
\color inherit
 window will appear, with a suggested label name automatically filled in.
 You can type another label name if you prefer.
 After you click OK, a grey box with the label name will appear next to
 the section you have labeled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reference this label somewhere in your document, simply click the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert cross-reference
\family default
\color inherit
 icon (the icon with the picture of the open book) at the top of the LyX
 document window.
 A 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Cross-reference
\family default
\color inherit
 window will appear, displaying the list of available labels you can reference,
 along with some formatting options.
 Click the label you want to reference, choose your desired reference format,
 then click OK.
 A grey box with the name of the label being referenced will then appear
 in your LyX document; when you compile your document, LaTeX will convert
 this reference into the appropriate number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, referencing the label we added to the section ``Math Basics''
 produces the result: 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Math-Basics"

\end_inset

.
 This is the section number corresponding to the section ``Math Basics''.
 Clearly, the number by itself is a bit ambiguous (your reader will almost
 surely think, ``What the heck is 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Math-Basics"

\end_inset

?'').
 When calling references, try to write some appropriate context for the
 reference.
 For example, we might write ``Read about the essential math features in
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Math-Basics"

\end_inset

.''
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Referencing Equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Referencing numbered equations works exactly the same way.
 Let's say we want to reference the following equation, which we have written

 environment so the equation is numbered:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
e^{\pi i}-1=0.\label{eq:BeautifulRelation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To reference this equation in your text, we follow the same label-reference
 approach.
 One important note: When you go to add a label to an equation, make sure
 your text cursor is 
\shape italic
inside
\shape default
 the math environment.
 If it is, the letters ``eq:'' will appear in the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Label
\family default
\color inherit
 window when you click the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert label
\family default
\color inherit
 icon, and you can fill in the name you want to give your equation.
 After naming your equation and clicking OK, a small box with the name of
 the equation will appear beside the equation number.
 If your text cursor is not inside the math environment when you click the
 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert label
\family default
\color inherit
 icon, the tell-tale sign is that the letters ``eq:'' will 
\shape italic
not
\shape default
 appear in the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Label
\family default
\color inherit
 window.
 In this case, LyX will associate your label with the beginning of the paragraph
 in which the equation is found, so be careful --- look for those green-light
 letters ``eq:''!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reference the equation in your document, click the Insert cross-reference
 icon, find the equation in the list of labels, choose your desired reference
 format, then click OK.
 For example: Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:BeautifulRelation"

\end_inset

 is one of the most beautiful relations in mathematics.
 Don't forget to write relevant context about the reference as appropriate!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
N.B.
 In many settings it is customary, when referencing equations, to include
 the equation number within parentheses.
 This option can be found in the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Label
\family default
\color inherit
 window, in the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Format
\family default
\color inherit
 dropdown menu.
 Clicking the option ``(<reference>)'' will cause the number associated
 with the selected label to appear within parentheses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hyperlinks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Related to references is LaTeX's handling of hyperlinks (links to websites,
 e-mails, or files).
 Insert a hyperlink by clicking the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert hyperlink
\family default
\color inherit
 icon at the top of the LyX document window.
 A 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Hyperlink
\family default
\color inherit
 window will appear; select the link type (website, e-mail address, or file)
 and fill in the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Target
\family default
\color inherit
 (the URL in the case of a website, the e-mail address in the case of an
 e-mail, or the file extension in the case of a file) and 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Name
\family default
\color inherit
 (the linked text that will appear in your document) fields.
 Note that if you leave the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Name
\family default
\color inherit
 field blank, LyX will use whatever you have entered in the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Target
\family default
\color inherit
 field as the linked text that appears in your document.
 Also note that, when you click OK in the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Hyperlink
\family default
\color inherit
 window, what appears in your LyX document is a grey box containing the
 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Name
\family default
\color inherit
 of the hyperlink; the actual hyperlink is generated only in the compiled
 document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, click the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert hyperlink
\family default
\color inherit
 icon and enter the following information:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
\color blue
Link type
\family default
\color inherit
: Web
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
\color blue
Target
\family default
\color inherit
: https://sites.google.com/site/tsewiki/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
\color blue
Name
\family default
\color inherit
: https://sites.google.com/site/tsewiki/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting link will appear as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "https://sites.google.com/site/tsewiki/"
target "https://sites.google.com/site/tsewiki/"

\end_inset

.
 If we leave the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Name
\family default
\color inherit
 field blank, the resulting link is the same.
 Finally, if we change the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Name
\family default
\color inherit
 to TSE Wiki, the resulting link will appear as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "TSE Wiki"
target "https://sites.google.com/site/tsewiki/"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As another example, suppose you want to add a link that, when clicked by
 a reader, will open a mail window addressed to your e-mail address, say
 example@fakemail.com.
 Click the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert hyperlink
\family default
\color inherit
 icon and enter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
\color blue
Link type
\family default
\color inherit
: Email
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
\color blue
Target
\family default
\color inherit
: example@fakemail.com
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
\color blue
Name
\family default
\color inherit
: example@fakemail.com
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting link will appear as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "example@fakemail.com"
target "example@fakemail.com"
type "mailto:"

\end_inset

.
 If you compile your LyX document and click on this link, a mail window
 of your default mail browser will open with ``example@fakemail.com'' filled
 in as the recipient.
 Try it out!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Figures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To insert a figure, click the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert graphics
\family default
\color inherit
 icon at the top of the LyX document window.
 A 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Graphics
\family default
\color inherit
 window will appear that allows you to select the image file on your computer
 and to set several image attributes.
 Here is an example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename TSE_Logo.jpg
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Greyedout
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\noun on
Note
\noun default
: To compile this document you will also need to download 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
`TSE_Logo.jpg' and put it in the same folder as the LyX file.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
If you want to change the graphic or its attributes at any time, simply
 click on the graphic in your LyX document.
 Note that LyX loads the specified image file each time you compile the
 document.
 Thus if you change the attributes of the image (e.g.
 resize the image), the graphic in your LyX document will change accordingly
 the next time you compile.
 If you move the image file to another location on your computer, the graphic
 box in your LyX document will display the words ``No file found''.
 For this reason, it is often most convenient to save all graphics used
 by your LyX document into a ``Graphics'' folder within the folder for your
 LyX document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, note that the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert graphics
\family default
\color inherit
 icon does not number the graphic.
 For numbered figures, use the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert figure float
\family default
\color inherit
 icon; see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Floats"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To insert a table, click the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert table
\family default
\color inherit
 icon at the top of the LyX document window.
 After clicking the icon, drag your mouse to indicate the desired number
 of rows and columns; note that you can move your mouse beyond the initial
 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times5$
\end_inset

 grid, to create larger tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have inserted the table, move your cursor into the table and fill
 in the cells.
 Note that when your text cursor is within the table environment, a table
 palette pops up at the bottom of the LyX document window, providing you
 with several options: add or delete rows or colums, put lines between rows
 or columns, align the text (left, center, right) within columns, ``merge''
 multiple cells within a row.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, tables are set ``inline'' with your body text, as with the following
 table: 
\begin_inset Tabular
<lyxtabular version="3" rows="2" columns="3">
<features tabularvalignment="middle">
<column alignment="left" valignment="top" width="0">
<column alignment="center" valignment="top" width="0">

<cell alignment="left" valignment="top" topline="true" leftline="true" usebox="none">

\begin_inset Text

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset
</cell>
</row>
</lyxtabular>

\end_inset

.
 This is usually not what you want.
 To put the table on a separate line, simply move your text cursor to just
 before the table and hit Return on your keyboard.
 You can then adjust the justification of the table (left, center, right)
 as desired by clicking the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Paragraph settings
\family default
\color inherit
 icon at the top of the LyX document window.
 For example, we have centered the following table, as well as set the text
 alignment of the columns, added border lines, and merged the two cells
 above ``Female'' and ``Male'':

Floats are often unruly beasts that have a life of their own, and have their
 own ideas on their own placement in the final output.
 If default placement style doesn't suit you (very possible), then you should
 try

 For example, you could try asking LaTeX to place floats

The above holds for tables, too, with one gotcha: longtables cannot live
 in floats, since floats cannot span over several pages.

 an empty line either at the beginning or the end of the table, place the
 cursor in it, and access

Bibliography

\begin_layout Standard
It is very easy to insert citations in LyX using BibTeX.
 First you need to have a BibTeX bibliography database, which is a fancy
 name for a simple text file containing references entered in BibTeX format.
 (You can easily find on-line BibTeX references for just about any paper
 or book.) Then you would need to follow several steps, in the right order:

 See Page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 in the Appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the same dialogue select a style for the bibliography (it's different
 from the one above), although you could readily stick with the default,
 and check the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Add Bibliography to ToC
\family default
\color inherit
 option (if you wish so).
 Note that not all bibliography styles are compatible with a given set-up,
 so if the document stops compiling after changing this style, then revert
 to defaults (`plain' or `plainnat').
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now you can access your citation references using the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Insert citation
\family default
\color inherit
 button.
 There you 
\family typewriter

Add
\family default

 one or more citations and select a formatting style

\begin_layout Subsection
Graphics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not very difficult to get very nice and precise graphics (nothing
 that you could ever achieve in MS Paint or Word!) into LyX documents, but
 you would need to use either LaTeX code or an external tool.
 Below are several pointers that you should investigate: 
\end_layout

With LyX 2.0 it is very easy to embed R code into your LyX documents.
 You need to have 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset

 installed (and on Windows, 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\color inherit
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter

 and then insert something similar to the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a complete list of options, check the ?RweaveLatex manual in R.
 In short, you can do in LyX any computation that you can do in R (which
 is a lot!).
 You can also use the Sweave mechanism to import your R workspace and thus
 access and display the results that you've stored within it.
 (If you want to print R objects into LyX, you will want to investigate
 two R packages: 
\family typewriter
xtable
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Hmisc:::latex()
\family default
.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a bonus, you can also insert (almost) any type of graph that R can produce
 (which, surprise, is a lot!); you'd need to insert in figure floats something
 similar to the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<<echo=FALSE,fig=TRUE>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Unicode and System Fonts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are ever in a position to mix different scripts in a single LyX document
 (say, English, French, Greek, Cyrillic and Chinese), you may want to consider
 changing the encoding of the document to 'utf8x' (or similar) in the 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Language
\family default
\color inherit
 tab in 
\family typewriter
\color blue
Document Settings
\family default
\color inherit
.
 But this may generate strange results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, try compiling the document using 
\family typewriter
\color blue
View PDF (XeTeX)
\family default
\color inherit
, which internally uses Unicode encoding, and is much more reliable in mixing
 exotic scripts.
 Remember, though, that you need to find a font that actually supports all
 the glyphs needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a bonus, in addition to supporting LaTeX fonts, XeTeX also supports system
 fonts (access

\end_inset

 or ``Comic Sans

\end_inset

! If you do so, then there's little point in using LyX (and LaTeX) in the
 first place! Keep in mind that the LaTeX fonts are high-quality fonts designed
 for professional looking printed output; simply select a non-default font.

The best way to grow familiar with LyX is to use it! We hope we have convinced
 you that the essential functions of LyX are extremely intuitive and easy-to-use
